# Technical Interview Quiz
In this project you will find various directories containing coding assignments that are meant to test your 
knowledge of Golang and programming in general. 

### Instructions
Please read the `readme.md` in each directory carefully, then proceed with the corresponding quiz. 

### Unit Tests
Some tests require you to write unit tests that prove your work. We have included `github.com/stretchr/testify` via 
`go.mod` to assist with this.  When making assertions in your tests you must use those provided by testify.

### External Sources
You are not permitted to use any third-party packages, with the exception of `github.com/stretchr/testify`.


### Good Luck!
